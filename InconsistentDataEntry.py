# use the fuzzywuzzy package to help identify which string are closest to each other.
# **Fuzzy matching:** The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered "closer" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another.
# Fuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings.
